This is the beginning.

After years of building products for other people, I'm making something for myself. Not because I need a portfolio or a personal brand, but because I want to remember what it feels like to build without a deadline, without a spec, without someone else's vision driving the work.

## Why a blog?

I've always processed things by writing. Code is one kind of writing — precise, functional, unforgiving. But there's another kind that I've neglected: the messy, exploratory kind. The kind where you don't know what you think until you've written it down.

This blog is for that.

## What to expect

I'll write about:

- **Technical things** — what I'm learning, what I'm building, problems I've solved
- **Career reflections** — lessons from a decade in the industry
- **Random thoughts** — whatever pulls my attention

No schedule. No SEO optimization. Just thinking out loud.

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading. More to come.
