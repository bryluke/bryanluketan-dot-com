This is the beginning.

After years of building products for other people, I'm making something for myself. Partially because I need a portfolio or a personal brand, but more that I want to remember what it feels like to build without a deadline, without a spec, without someone else's vision driving the work.

## Why a blog?

I've always processed things through writing. Code is one kind of writing — precise, functional, unforgiving. But there's another kind that I've neglected: the messy, exploratory kind. The kind where you don't know what you think until you've written it down.

This blog is for that.

## What to expect

I'll write about:

- **Technical things** — what I'm learning, what I'm building, problems I've solved
- **Career reflections** — lessons from a decade in the industry
- **Random thoughts** — whatever pulls my attention

No schedule. No deadlines. Just thinking out loud, and hopefully building things of value in public.

If you've made it this far, thanks for being here and reading. More to come.
