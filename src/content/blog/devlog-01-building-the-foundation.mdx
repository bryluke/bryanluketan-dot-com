This is the first devlog for bryanluketan.com — documenting how I built this site from scratch. The goal: a minimal personal site with a blog, good SEO, and room to grow.

I must caveat that I'm leveraging AI for inspiration and help in the implementation. I'm not some super juiced programmer that has seen the ancient magicks hand-woven together to create this wondrous digital world we all live in. Rather, I'm just a job changer that managed to self-learn enough to get into the industry and start contributing.

I am proud to say that I learned web development with JS DOM for a good 3 months and built multiple apps without React, all within a time where AI was not yet around. I have the awkward, short glimpse of what coding was like referencing documentation, hunting for answers in StackOverflow, and sitting for hours before realising that I screwed up with a single character somewhere in my code. Yet, I also am now part of this equally disorienting reality of vibe code, mega technological jumps, and massive hype around AI.

I'm just here looking to learn, building my own thing in my small little corner of the internet I get to call my own. If you're reading this, thanks! I hope that slowly, but surely, I'll grow to give more tangible value in the things I build and write. Now onto the meat...

## The Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** throughout
- **Vanilla CSS** with CSS Layers (no Tailwind, no CSS-in-JS)
- **Zustand** for theme state management
- **MDX** for blog posts via gray-matter + next-mdx-remote
- **Vercel** for hosting, analytics, and speed insights

## Theme System

The site has a dynamic theme system inspired by Arc Browser. Users can:

1. Toggle between light and dark mode
2. Pick a custom accent color

The accent color is stored in HSL and automatically adjusted for contrast — lighter in dark mode, more saturated in light mode. Four variants are generated:

```css
--color-accent-user    /* main, contrast-adjusted */
--color-accent-light   /* +30 lightness */
--color-accent-dark    /* -30 lightness */
--color-accent-subtle  /* low saturation, for backgrounds */
```

Theme state persists to localStorage via Zustand, and a blocking script in `<head>` applies it before first paint to prevent flash of unstyled content.

## Blog System

I wanted a blog that's:

- Version-controlled (just MDX files in a folder)
- Type-safe (validated categories and tags)
- Fast (server-rendered, no client JS for content)

### File Structure

```
src/content/
  blog/
    hello-world.mdx
    devlog-01-building-the-foundation.mdx
  config.ts  # defines valid categories and tags
src/lib/
  blog.ts    # parsing and query functions
```

### Frontmatter

Each post has typed frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
description: "For listings and SEO"
datetime: "2025-01-01T10:00:00"
category: "tech"
tags: ["typescript", "nextjs"]
published: true
---
```

The `datetime` field (not just date) allows multiple posts per day with correct ordering. The `published` flag hides drafts without deleting them.

### Strict Validation

Categories and tags are defined in `src/content/config.ts`. If I typo a tag, the build fails:

```
Invalid tag "typsecript" in my-post.mdx.
Allowed tags: typescript, javascript, react, ...
```

This is intentional friction — it prevents tag sprawl and keeps taxonomy deliberate.

## Blog Features

Beyond basic listing and rendering, the blog includes:

### Filter Pages

- `/blog/category/[category]` — browse by category
- `/blog/tag/[tag]` — browse by tag

Categories and tags in post headers are clickable links.

### Reading Time

Estimated reading time (at 200 wpm) shown on listings and posts.

### Previous/Next Navigation

Each post has links to adjacent posts at the bottom for easy browsing.

### RSS Feed

Available at `/feed.xml` with autodiscovery in the HTML head. Includes title, description, date, and category for each post.

## SEO Setup

### Site Configuration

All site-wide values are centralized in `src/config/site.ts`:

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  url: 'https://www.bryanluketan.com',
  name: 'Bryan Luke Tan',
  description: '...',
  author: 'Bryan Luke Tan',
  email: 'hello@bryanluketan.com',
}
```

This is imported everywhere — changing the URL in one place updates sitemap, RSS, canonical URLs, and all metadata.

### Canonical URLs

Every page has a canonical URL pointing to the `www.` subdomain. Vercel redirects the apex domain to www, so canonicals match.

### JSON-LD

Blog posts include structured data for rich search results:

```json
{
  "@type": "BlogPosting",
  "headline": "...",
  "author": { "@type": "Person", "name": "Bryan Luke Tan" },
  "datePublished": "...",
  "url": "..."
}
```

### Dynamic Sitemap

The sitemap at `/sitemap.xml` is generated dynamically and includes:

- Static pages (home, about, blog)
- All published blog posts (with actual publish date)
- All category pages
- All tag pages

## Analytics

Using Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights. Both are privacy-friendly (no cookies, no consent banner needed) and integrate with one line each in the root layout.

## What's Next

The foundation is solid. Future additions might include:

- Code syntax highlighting
- Table of contents for long posts
- Related posts by shared tags
- Newsletter signup

But for now, the site works. I can write, commit, and deploy.
