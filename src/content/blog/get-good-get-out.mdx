"Get good, get out."

That's my motto for this year. Let me explain what it means.

## The Fear

I'm afraid to lose my job. Not because I think I'm about to, but because I know how much I depend on it. One employer, one income stream, one point of failure. If that goes away, what do I have?

That fear has been sitting with me for a while, and I recently realized that it's not really about the job... it's about confidence, or the lack thereof.

## Root Problem

Here's the uncomfortable truth I had to face: I don't have enough verifiable proof that I'm good at what I do. Not for recruiters or hiring managers but for *myself*.

I've stayed in my startup while 80% of the company changed each year. I've worked on plenty of things with a team that cannot seem to decide a specific direction to commit on... It doesn't matter how many features I've built or internal problems I've solved, **ALL of that** lives behind company walls in codebases I can't show, on products I don't own. When I imagine having to prove my skills tomorrow, I don't have a clear answer.

That uncertainty is what keeps me feeling trapped.

## My Context

What makes this harder is that I started late. The first 10 years that other people were grinding to form their foundations... I've dug my foundations in a really different domain, my religion.

I've essentially spent my 20s pursuing religion as a Christian missionary and ministry worker. I the end of that era came with my degree in theological studies when, due to personal reasons, I made the decision that I couldn't continue down this path.

I self-taught programming and managed to get a job as a web developer. However, while doing so, I feel like I've burned up so much of myself that I'm beginning to not have a life outside of work. And that's why I feel even more stuck.

## The Way Out

"Get good, get out" isn't about quitting my job, it's about not being afraid to lose it.

The way I get there is through building evidence... so much evidence that I'm good that I cannot deny the fact. Not a polished portfolio for appearances but real, finished things that prove to me I can make stuff people want to use.

This site is where that happens.

## What This Site Is

This is my sandbox. A place to explore web development, game development, and whatever else pulls my curiosity. But it's not just for tinkering, it's for finishing.

Every game, tool, or experiment I ship here is a complete artifact. Not a work-in-progress. Not a "I'll add more later." A done thing, scoped tight, polished within its constraints.

The principles I'm holding myself to:

- **Ship complete.** Define "done" before I start. No feature creep, no endless iteration.
- **V2 is a new product.** If I want to expand something, I build it fresh. The original stays finished.
- **No ongoing commitments.** Each project is self-contained. I'm not signing up to maintain anything forever.
- **Build in public.** Document what I learn. Show the work, not just the results.

## Why This Matters

Anyone can say they're "on a journey" or "learning in public." The signal that separates talk from proof is finishing things.

Every completed project is evidence. Evidence that I can scope, build, and ship. Evidence that I can take something from idea to artifact. Evidence, to myself, that I'm not just someone with potential, but someone who executes.

The confidence I'm looking for doesn't come from affirmations or job titles. It comes from stacking up undeniable proof that I can do the work.

## The First Move

One game. One week. One core mechanic. Ship it.

That's the commitment. Not a grand vision but the next concrete thing.

## Ask For Help

The secondary goal for this year that I'm forced to do is to learn to ask for help.

I'm so used to working by myself these past 3 years that it's seeped quite deep into my person that I will have to find a way to make things work myself.

However, that's not true. There are people who want to help, who want to support. That's another supporting reason why I'm trying this "build in public" thing instead of "grind leetcode in the dark of my room".

I hate getting feedback, I hate receiving help. It makes me feel weak and useless. But I'm trying to unlearn that.

I'll be adding ways for people to interact and support — but that's for later. For now, if you've read this far, thank you. Hold me accountable if you choose to. It would mean so much.

Get good, get out. The getting good starts now.
