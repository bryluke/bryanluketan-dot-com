# Roadmap

A living map of topics to explore. Not a curriculum to complete, but a compass for what to build next. Topics get added as curiosity leads. Each one is explored through actual projects, demos, and writeups.

## How this works

Each topic lives at `/explore/[topic]`. Within a topic, individual posts document specific learnings, projects, or experiments. The goal isn't comprehensive coverage. It's honest exploration of whatever's in front of me.

## Topics

### Web Analytics & SEO
Understanding how the web sees you. Tracking, measuring, and making things findable.
- How web analytics actually works (not just installing a script)
- Building a dashboard for this site's own data
- SEO fundamentals: schemas, structured data, sitemaps, OpenGraph
- Search Console, indexing, and what Google actually cares about
- Privacy-friendly analytics vs. the tracking industry

### React Patterns
Going deeper than "it works". Understanding why patterns exist and when they break.
- Component composition patterns
- State management approaches and tradeoffs
- Performance patterns (memoization, suspense, streaming)
- Custom hooks that actually make sense
- Server components vs. client components (when and why)

### Design Patterns & UI
The intersection of design thinking and implementation.
- Layout systems (grid, flexbox, and when to use which)
- Animation and interaction patterns
- Responsive design beyond media queries
- Accessibility as a design constraint
- Design systems and component libraries (building one from scratch)

### Web Technologies
The platform underneath the frameworks.
- Browser APIs worth knowing (Intersection Observer, Web Workers, etc.)
- Networking: HTTP, WebSockets, SSE, caching
- Storage: cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB, and when each fits
- Security: CORS, CSP, authentication patterns
- Web performance: Core Web Vitals, what actually matters

### JavaScript & TypeScript
The language itself, beyond framework-specific usage.
- TypeScript patterns that actually help (not just satisfying the compiler)
- Async patterns: promises, generators, streams
- The event loop and how JS actually runs
- Module systems and bundling
- Testing strategies

### HTML & CSS
The foundations that everyone skips and then regrets.
- Semantic HTML and why it matters
- CSS architecture (layers, cascade, specificity)
- Modern CSS features (container queries, :has(), nesting)
- CSS animations and transitions
- Forms and native browser capabilities

### Data Structures & Algorithms
Not for interviews. For understanding how things work.
- Common structures and when they show up in real code
- Algorithm patterns that appear in everyday work
- Big O in practice (not just theory)
- Problems worth solving for understanding, not memorization

### Games
Building things that are fun. Learning graphics, physics, and interaction design.
- Canvas and WebGL basics
- Game loops and frame management
- Physics and collision detection
- Input handling and game feel
- Shipping a complete, playable thing

### AI & Machine Learning
The technological shift that's impossible to ignore.
- Building with LLM APIs (prompting, tool use, agents)
- The Claude Agent SDK (personal project #1)
- AI-assisted development workflows
- Understanding what AI can and can't do
- Building useful AI-powered tools

## What's next

**Starting with: Web Analytics & SEO**

It's meta (the site itself is the data source), it's practical (directly useful for growth), and it touches real infrastructure (not just a tutorial exercise).

After that: wherever curiosity and work lead.
